        - paragraph [ref=e22]: Hello! I'm excited to work through this recall session with you today. Let's start with our first topic. **Can you tell me about the mitochondria and what role it plays in a cell?** Take your time and share whatever comes to mind about this cellular structure.

        - paragraph [ref=e29]: AI Tutor
        - paragraph [ref=e30]: Great start! You've got the key phrase down. Now let's dig a bit deeper into what that actually means. **What does it mean for the mitochondria to be the "powerhouse" of the cell? What specifically does it produce or do?**

        - paragraph [ref=e34]: "I appreciate you sharing what you remember! Even partial recall is valuable - it shows your brain is making connections with this material. Let me briefly reinforce the key point: **Water freezes at 0°C (or 32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.** This is one of those fundamental reference points in science that helps us understand phase transitions. --- Great news - that was actually our final recall point for this session! You've worked through the entire set, and I hope this Socratic approach helped strengthen your memory. Remember, struggling with recall is actually a good sign - it means you're actively retrieving information, which makes those neural pathways stronger for next time. **Quick reflection:** What did you find most helpful about this recall session? And is there anything from today's topics you'd like to review further? Thanks for engaging so thoughtfully throughout our session! 🌟"
