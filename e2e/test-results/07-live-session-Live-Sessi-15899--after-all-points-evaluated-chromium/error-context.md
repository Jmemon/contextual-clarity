        - paragraph [ref=e22]: Hello! I'm excited to work through this recall session with you today. Let's begin with our first topic. **Here's my opening question:** Can you tell me about the role of mitochondria in cells? What do you remember about what they do? Take your time and share whatever comes to mind - even if you're not completely sure, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

        - paragraph [ref=e26]: "I appreciate you sharing what you remember! Even partial recall is valuable - it shows your brain is working to retrieve the information. Let me briefly reinforce the key point: **Water freezes at 0°C (or 32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.** This is one of those foundational facts in physics that helps us understand phase transitions. --- Great news - that was actually our final recall point for today's session! 🎉 You've worked through the entire recall set. How are you feeling about the session overall? Is there anything from today's topics you'd like to revisit or discuss further before we wrap up?"
