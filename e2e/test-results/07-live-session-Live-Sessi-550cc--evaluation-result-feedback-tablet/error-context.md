        - paragraph [ref=e22]: Hello! I'm excited to work through this recall session with you. Let's start with our first topic. **Here's my opening question:** When you think about how cells generate energy to power all their activities, what comes to mind? What cellular structure is responsible for this energy production? Take your time and share whatever you remember about this!

        - paragraph [ref=e26]: "I appreciate you reaching out! However, I need to see what the learner actually said or struggled with during our conversation to provide appropriate feedback. Could you help me understand the context? For example: - What question did I ask the learner? - What was their response or attempt? - What specifically did they struggle with? Once I know what they remembered (even partially) and where they got stuck, I can: 1. Acknowledge and celebrate what they DID recall 2. Gently reinforce the key concept about water's freezing point 3. Transition smoothly to wrap up the session Since this is the final recall point, I want to make sure they leave feeling good about their effort and with the key information reinforced appropriately. What did the learner say when they attempted to recall this information?"
