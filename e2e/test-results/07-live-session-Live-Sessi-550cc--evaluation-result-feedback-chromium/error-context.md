Here's my opening question: **What can you tell me about the role of mitochondria in cells?** Take your time and share whatever comes to mind about what mitochondria do."

        - paragraph [ref=e26]: "I appreciate your effort in working through that challenging recall! Even when we struggle to retrieve information, the act of trying strengthens our memory pathways for next time. Let me briefly reinforce this key point: **Water freezes at 0°C (or 32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.** This is one of water's fundamental phase transition points - a concept that comes up frequently in science. --- Great news - you've completed all the recall points in this session! 🎉 **Session Summary:** You worked through the material on water's freezing point. Remember, struggling with recall is actually a valuable part of the learning process - it helps identify what needs more review and strengthens your memory for future attempts. **Moving Forward:** Consider reviewing the concepts from today's session again in a day or two. Spaced repetition will help solidify this information in your long-term memory. Is there anything about today's topic you'd like to clarify before we wrap up, or are you ready to conclude the session?"
