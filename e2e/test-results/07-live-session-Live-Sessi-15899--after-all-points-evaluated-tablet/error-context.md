        - paragraph [ref=e22]: Hello! I'm excited to help you recall what you've learned. Let's start with our first topic. **Can you tell me about the mitochondria and what role it plays in the cell?** Take your time and share whatever comes to mind about this organelle.

        - paragraph [ref=e26]: "I appreciate your willingness to work through that challenging recall! Even when we struggle to retrieve something, the effort itself strengthens the memory pathway for next time. Let me briefly reinforce this key point: **Water freezes at 0°C (or 32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.** This is one of those fundamental reference points in science that's worth having at your fingertips. --- Great news - that was actually our final recall point for this session! 🎉 You've worked through the entire set, and I want to acknowledge the effort you put in. Recall sessions can be mentally demanding, but they're one of the most effective ways to strengthen long-term memory. Even the points where you struggled are now better encoded in your memory because of the retrieval attempt. **Quick reflection before we wrap up:** How did this recall session feel for you? Was there anything about the process that was particularly helpful or challenging?"
