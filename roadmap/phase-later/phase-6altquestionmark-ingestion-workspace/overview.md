The best thing for the ingestion piece — which might be the most important piece of this app, more so than these recall sessions — might even go beyond transcript and resource. Maybe you feed this thing the resource and you go through the resource together with the help of the AI, and you sort of just talk at it. Talk through the material, go down the rabbit holes, go work through it yourself, putting an emphasis on building real understanding. And then maybe if you're really going crazy, you use a fitness band or some kind of biometric device to track when somebody is beginning to become activated by whatever they're talking about, and use that to point them in that direction — but that is not for this space, that would be later.

But like, imagine if Elsevier or one of the big journals was instead structured like this first, where instead of just reading through the paper you basically go through it in a session like this. And maybe in talking through it — maybe even talking through multiple resources at the same time — you have a thing that's basically a notes organizer on the other side. And this can be a way to develop ideas through dialogue. This absolutely still dovetails maybe with the recall sessions, because you can sort of go through certain points that you extract during these sessions repeatedly, so you remember them better, they factor into your mental model better, etc., whatever. However, this extraction piece is interesting.

And all of this is guided by — I think — the notion of craft, and trying to build products that emphasize effort. That, I think, is where the winds are blowing: instead of instant gratification style software, it's software that is to be used by people who want to engage in effort.


When describing this session, I'm imagining some agent driven session that makes going through the paper at least talking through the paper, more interactive than just an audio recording on the side. Including the notes and what not.
