# Personal Assistant UX Principles

## Core Philosophy

The personal-assistant-ux style exposes only **constructive functionality**—tasks that feel like the user is progressing in some way.

## The Guiding Heuristic

**Tasks should do MORE for the user than for the AI.**

### What to Expose (High-Signal Tasks)

- Tasks that *feel* progressive
- Tasks where the user is doing core work that actually **serves them**
- Example: Having the user talk through raw resources—this is the work they SHOULD be doing

### What to Hide (Managerial Tasks)

- Tasks where the user communicates their internal concepts to the AI by managing app logistics
- These require the user to bear the mental load of translating what they want into the settings available in the app
- Managerial tasks are headaches/annoying—best hidden on the mobile app, accessible on desktop

## Summary

The distinction isn't about complexity—it's about **who benefits**. If a task primarily helps the AI understand the user's preferences (configuration, management, organization), hide it. If a task is the user engaging with their actual learning material, surface it prominently.
