## Conceptual Knowledge — Psychology & Behavior

### 1. Atomic Habits: The Habit Loop

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Every habit follows a four-step loop: cue → craving → response → reward.
- **Context:** James Clear's framework. To build a habit, make each step easier; to break one, invert each step.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Environment design beats willpower for habit change — modify surroundings to make good behaviors obvious and bad ones invisible.
- **Context:** Putting your phone in another room eliminates the cue entirely. Willpower is finite; environments are persistent.

---

### 2. Dunning-Kruger Effect

**Point 1**
- **Content:** People with low competence in a domain overestimate their ability because the skills needed to produce a correct answer are the same skills needed to recognize one.
- **Context:** Kruger and Dunning, 1999. Beginners don't know what they don't know; experts underestimate theirs.

---

### 3. Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Continuing a course of action because of past investment (time, money, effort) rather than evaluating future value. Past costs are irrecoverable and irrelevant to optimal decisions.
- **Context:** The rational question is always "given where I am now, is continuing the best use of my next hour/dollar?"

---

### 4. Dopamine & Motivation

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Dopamine drives anticipation and wanting, not pleasure itself. It spikes before a reward, not during consumption.
- **Context:** Wolfram Schultz's experiments: dopamine fires at the cue predicting a reward. Better than expected → spike; worse → dip below baseline.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Variable reward schedules (unpredictable timing/magnitude) produce the highest dopamine and most compulsive behavior — the mechanism behind slot machines and social media.
- **Context:** Skinner's operant conditioning. Fixed schedules produce moderate engagement; variable schedules produce intense, persistent engagement.

---

### 5. The Lindy Effect

**Point 1**
- **Content:** For non-perishable things (ideas, technologies, books), the longer something has survived, the longer its expected remaining lifespan.
- **Context:** Taleb. A book in print for 100 years is expected to last another 100. Things that survive long-term have demonstrated robustness.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Biology & Health

### 6. Caffeine & Adenosine

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors without activating them, preventing the drowsiness signal. It masks sleep pressure rather than creating energy.
- **Context:** Adenosine still accumulates behind the blockade — you crash when caffeine wears off.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Regular use causes the brain to grow more adenosine receptors (tolerance). Withdrawal headaches occur from sudden unblocked adenosine causing vasodilation.
- **Context:** Tolerance develops in ~7-12 days; full reset takes 2-9 days of abstinence.

---

### 7. How Muscle Growth Works

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Resistance training causes microtears in muscle fibers. Repair via protein synthesis rebuilds them thicker and stronger (hypertrophy).
- **Context:** Progressive overload is necessary — the stimulus must exceed what the muscle is adapted to.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Muscle protein synthesis peaks ~24-48 hours post-training and returns to baseline by ~72 hours, making 2-3x/week per muscle group optimal.
- **Context:** This is why full-body or upper/lower splits often outperform bro-splits for natural lifters.

---

### 8. Sleep & Memory Consolidation

**Point 1**
- **Content:** During slow-wave sleep, the hippocampus replays the day's experiences at accelerated speed, transferring memories from short-term to long-term storage.
- **Context:** Learning followed by sleep produces significantly better retention than the same period awake.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Sleep deprivation reduces the brain's capacity to form new memories by ~40%.
- **Context:** Matthew Walker's research. Sleep is needed both before learning (to prepare) and after (to consolidate).

---

### 9. Intermittent Fasting Mechanisms

**Point 1**
- **Content:** During fasting, insulin drops, signaling fat cells to release stored fatty acids for energy (lipolysis). This shift enhances after ~12-16 hours.
- **Context:** Insulin is the switch: high = storage mode, low = access stores. Constant snacking keeps you in permanent storage mode.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Autophagy — cellular self-cleaning where damaged proteins are broken down and recycled — is upregulated during extended fasting (24-48+ hours) via mTOR suppression and AMPK activation.
- **Context:** Ohsumi won the 2016 Nobel Prize for autophagy mechanisms. Distinct from fat-burning benefits of shorter fasts.

---

### 10. Sarcomere Contraction (Sliding Filament Theory)

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Actin and myosin filaments slide past each other within sarcomeres. Myosin heads bind to actin, pivot (power stroke), release, and repeat — powered by ATP hydrolysis.
- **Context:** The filaments don't shorten — they overlap more. Without ATP, myosin stays bound to actin (rigor mortis).

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Eccentric contractions (lengthening under load) cause more damage than concentric, producing greater hypertrophy stimulus and more DOMS.
- **Context:** Fewer motor units are recruited eccentrically, so each active fiber bears more load. This is why you can lower more than you can lift.

---

### 11. Mind-Muscle Connection

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Consciously focusing on the target muscle during exercise increases EMG activation and, over time, greater hypertrophy versus just moving the weight.
- **Context:** Schoenfeld et al. (2018). Effect diminishes at very heavy loads (>80% 1RM). Most useful for isolation exercises.

---

### 12. Proprioception & Balance

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Proprioception is the body's sense of its own position in space, mediated by muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and joint receptors feeding the cerebellum.
- **Context:** It's how you touch your nose with your eyes closed. Alcohol impairs proprioception — hence sobriety balance tests.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Balance training improves proprioceptive acuity by strengthening neural pathways between peripheral sensors and the cerebellum, reducing injury risk.
- **Context:** Proprioception degrades with age (fall risk) and after injury (re-injury risk without balance rehab).

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Math & Information Theory

### 13. Central Limit Theorem

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. Rule of thumb: n ≥ 30.
- **Context:** Foundation of statistical inference — why confidence intervals and hypothesis tests work even when raw data isn't normal.

---

### 14. Shannon Entropy

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Shannon entropy H = -Σ p(x) log₂ p(x) measures average uncertainty. A fair coin has H = 1 bit; a 99% biased coin has H ≈ 0.08 bits.
- **Context:** Shannon, 1948. Higher entropy = harder to predict = more information per symbol.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Data compression cannot beat the entropy rate — it's the theoretical floor on compactness. Random noise has maximum entropy and is incompressible.
- **Context:** Huffman/arithmetic coding approach this limit by assigning shorter codes to more probable symbols.

---

### 15. Definition of a Group (Abstract Algebra)

**Point 1**
- **Content:** A group is a set G with operation · satisfying: closure, associativity, identity element e, and inverses for every element.
- **Context:** The group axioms capture "reversible composition" — abstracting patterns from number systems, symmetries, and permutations.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** (ℤ, +) is a group (identity 0, inverse -n). (ℤ, ×) is not — most integers lack a multiplicative inverse in ℤ.
- **Context:** The same set can form a group under one operation and fail under another.

**Point 3**
- **Content:** If the operation is also commutative (a·b = b·a), it's abelian. Matrix multiplication GL(n) is non-abelian — AB ≠ BA in general.
- **Context:** Named after Niels Henrik Abel. Most symmetry groups in physics are non-abelian.

---

### 16. Fractal Dimension

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Fractal dimension quantifies how detail changes with scale. The Koch snowflake has dimension log(4)/log(3) ≈ 1.26 — more than a line but less than a plane.
- **Context:** Formula: d = log(N)/log(S) where N = self-similar pieces and S = scaling factor.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Britain's coastline has fractal dimension ~1.25 — measured length increases without bound as the ruler shrinks (the "coastline paradox").
- **Context:** Mandelbrot, 1967. A straight border has dimension 1.0; a coastline's fractional dimension captures its roughness.

---

### 17. Persistent Homology

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Persistent homology tracks topological features (components, loops, voids) as a distance threshold increases. Features persisting across many scales are signal; short-lived ones are noise.
- **Context:** Grow balls around points in a cloud; track births and deaths of features as balls overlap and simplices form.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Persistence diagrams plot features as (birth, death) points. Far from diagonal = robust structure; near diagonal = noise.
- **Context:** Finds the "shape" of data without assuming a model. Detects loops and voids, not just connected clusters.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Philosophy & Literature

### 18. Existentialism: Radical Freedom

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Sartre's "existence precedes essence" — humans have no predefined purpose. You exist first, then define yourself through choices and actions.
- **Context:** Contrasts with essentialism (a knife is designed to cut). Both liberating and terrifying — no excuses.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** "Bad faith" (mauvaise foi) is denying your own freedom by pretending you have no choice — hiding behind roles or determinism.
- **Context:** Acknowledging freedom means acknowledging you could always choose otherwise, even if consequences are severe.

---

### 19. Kafka's Metamorphosis as Alienation

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Gregor Samsa's transformation externalizes alienation he already felt as a dehumanized wage earner valued only for his income.
- **Context:** The horror isn't the transformation — it's how little changes. The family already treated him as non-human; the insect body makes the metaphor literal.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Finance & Decision-Making

### 20. Compound Interest

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Compound interest earns interest on interest, creating exponential growth: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Most growth is back-loaded — the last decade dominates.
- **Context:** $10K at 7% for 30 years ≈ $76K; for 40 years ≈ $150K. Time in the market dominates all other variables.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Rule of 72: divide 72 by the annual rate to estimate doubling time. 8% → ~9 years. 12% → ~6 years.
- **Context:** Works because ln(2) ≈ 0.693. Accurate within ~1% for rates between 4-15%.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Physics & Engineering

### 21. How SSDs Store Data

**Point 1**
- **Content:** SSDs store bits by trapping electrons in floating-gate transistors. SLC = 1 bit/cell (fast, durable), TLC = 3 bits, QLC = 4 bits (cheap, less durable).
- **Context:** More bits per cell = cheaper but slower. Charge levels get harder to distinguish as you pack more bits.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Flash cells wear out after finite write cycles. The controller uses wear leveling to distribute writes; TRIM lets the OS report unused blocks.
- **Context:** SLC endures ~100K cycles, QLC ~1K. Without TRIM, unnecessary write amplification occurs.

---

### 22. How Vinyl Records Encode Stereo Sound

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Stereo vinyl uses a 45/45 system: groove walls angled at 45° encode left and right channels separately. The stylus reads both simultaneously.
- **Context:** Backwards-compatible with mono (stylus reads the lateral sum L+R). Invented by Blumlein, standardized 1958.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Vinyl "warmth" comes from even-order harmonic distortion from the physical stylus, plus RIAA equalization that shapes frequency response.
- **Context:** RIAA eq boosts bass and cuts treble during cutting, reverses during playback. Digital is more accurate; vinyl's color is preference.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Learning Science

### 23. Spaced Repetition: The Forgetting Curve

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve: memory decays exponentially — ~50% forgotten within an hour, ~70% within 24 hours without review.
- **Context:** Discovered 1885. Meaningful information decays more slowly but follows the general pattern.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Each review at the point of near-forgetting resets the curve with a shallower decay rate. This is the basis of spaced repetition.
- **Context:** Spacing increases after each success: 1 day → 3 → 7 → 21 days. This is what FSRS calculates.

---

## Procedural/Technical

### 24. TypeScript Generics

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Generics let you write functions/types across multiple types while preserving type safety: `function identity<T>(arg: T): T` — unlike `any`, the type info is preserved.
- **Context:** Without generics, you choose between safety (separate functions per type) and flexibility (`any`). Generics give both.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** `extends` constrains generics: `<T extends { length: number }>` restricts to types with a `length` property.
- **Context:** Without constraints, `T` could be anything and you can't access properties. Common: `T extends string`, `K extends keyof T`.

---

### 25. Git Rebase vs Merge

**Point 1**
- **Content:** `git rebase main` replays your commits on top of latest main, creating linear history. It rewrites hashes — never rebase pushed/shared commits.
- **Context:** Golden rule: rebase local work before sharing, never rebase shared work.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Merge commits preserve branching history and are non-destructive. Use when you want to document parallel development.
- **Context:** Merge = "railroad track" graph; rebase = straight line.

---

### 26. Git Reflog & Recovery

**Point 1**
- **Content:** `git reflog` records every HEAD movement — commits, checkouts, rebases, resets. References persist at least 30 days even after destructive operations.
- **Context:** Local only (not pushed). It's an undo history for the entire repo.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** To recover "lost" commits: find the hash in reflog, then `git checkout <hash>` or `git reset --hard <hash>`.
- **Context:** Commits are only truly deleted after garbage collection (~30 days unreachable).

---

### 27. React Re-rendering Mental Model

**Point 1**
- **Content:** A component re-renders when its state changes or when its parent re-renders. Props don't independently trigger re-renders — the parent's re-render passes new props.
- **Context:** State should live as close as possible to where it's used to minimize cascading re-renders.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Referential equality matters in dependency arrays: `{a:1} !== {a:1}` (different references). `useMemo`/`useCallback` stabilize references to prevent unnecessary effects.
- **Context:** Objects/arrays/functions compare by reference, not value. This is a common source of infinite loops in useEffect.

---

### 28. Backpropagation & Computational Graphs

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The forward pass builds a DAG where each node is an operation and edges carry tensors, recording everything for reverse-mode gradient computation.
- **Context:** PyTorch builds this dynamically; TensorFlow historically built it statically.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Backprop applies the chain rule backwards: each node multiplies its local gradient by the downstream gradient, computing ∂Loss/∂weight for all weights in one pass.
- **Context:** One backward pass computes all gradients simultaneously — this efficiency is why neural networks are trainable at scale.

**Point 3**
- **Content:** Vanishing gradients: repeated multiplication of small derivatives through many layers shrinks gradients to near-zero. ReLU and skip connections mitigate this.
- **Context:** Sigmoid/tanh saturate where derivative → 0. Skip connections reduce the chain length. This is why ResNets can be hundreds of layers deep.

---

### 29. How Espresso Extraction Works

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Standard espresso: ~18g coffee, ~9 bars pressure, ~36g liquid in 25-30 seconds (1:2 ratio). Time is the primary diagnostic for dialing in.
- **Context:** Too fast = grind finer, too slow = grind coarser. Grind size, dose, and yield interact.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Under-extraction → sour (acids extract first); over-extraction → bitter (bitter compounds extract last). Target: ~18-22% extraction.
- **Context:** Grind size is the primary lever — finer = more surface area = faster extraction.

---

### 30. The Ralph Wiggum Loop

**Point 1**
- **Content:** A bash loop that runs a fresh agent instance against a spec, checks for completion, and retries — piping full output (failures, stack traces) back as input.
- **Context:** Geoffrey Huntley. Named for Ralph Wiggum's naive persistence. Unsanitized failure feedback creates a "contextual pressure cooker."

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Power comes from brute-force iteration with fresh context: each retry avoids context pollution but inherits the previous attempt's full output.
- **Context:** LLMs are stochastic — same prompt, different outputs. Combined with failure feedback, the loop eventually converges on a solution.

---

## Creative/Design

### 31. The Rule of Thirds in Composition

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Divide the frame into a 3×3 grid. Placing subjects along lines or at intersections creates more dynamic compositions than centering.
- **Context:** Breaking this rule works when symmetry is intentional.

---

### 32. Color Temperature in Lighting

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Color temperature in Kelvin: warm (~2700K) is yellow-orange/intimate, cool (~5000-6500K) is blue-white/alert. Directly affects circadian rhythm and mood.
- **Context:** Blue-rich cool light suppresses melatonin; warm light supports natural melatonin onset.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Music Theory

### 33. Why Minor Keys Sound Sad

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The minor scale's defining feature is a flattened third — 3 semitones (minor third) instead of 4 (major third). This smaller interval creates a "darker" quality.
- **Context:** Major third (5:4 ratio) is more consonant than minor third (6:5). Whether the sad association is psychoacoustic or cultural is debated.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Minor keys also flatten the 6th and 7th degrees (natural minor). Harmonic minor raises the 7th, adding urgency; melodic minor raises both 6th and 7th ascending.
- **Context:** Natural minor feels resigned, harmonic minor dramatic, melodic minor bittersweet.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Ecology

### 34. How Mushroom Mycelium Networks Work

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Mycelium is a network of thread-like hyphae that decomposes organic matter by secreting enzymes externally and absorbing nutrients. The mushroom is just the fruiting body.
- **Context:** A single honey fungus in Oregon covers 2,385 acres — one of Earth's largest organisms.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Mycorrhizal fungi form the "wood wide web" — symbiosis where fungus provides trees water/phosphorus and trees provide carbon/sugars. Trees can transfer nutrients to each other through the network.
- **Context:** Suzanne Simard showed "mother trees" send carbon to struggling seedlings through these connections.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Yoga & Breathwork

### 35. Ujjayi Breath & Vagal Tone

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Ujjayi involves constricting the glottis, creating an "ocean" sound that slows breathing and extends the exhale — stimulating the vagus nerve toward parasympathetic dominance.
- **Context:** Longer exhales increase vagal tone and lower heart rate. It's a physiological brake, not just a mental one.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Vagal tone (measured by HRV) indicates parasympathetic strength. Higher HRV = greater stress resilience. Regular breathwork increases resting HRV over time.
- **Context:** Slow breathing at ~6 breaths/minute maximizes HRV by synchronizing with the baroreflex.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — AI & Machine Learning

### 36. How LLM Tokenization Works

**Point 1**
- **Content:** LLMs split text into tokens via Byte Pair Encoding: start with characters, iteratively merge the most frequent pair until reaching target vocab size (~100K for GPT-4).
- **Context:** Common words become single tokens; rare words split into subwords. This handles misspellings and neologisms.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Token count ≠ word count (~1 token ≈ ¾ word in English). Context windows and pricing are measured in tokens. Non-English text tokenizes less efficiently.
- **Context:** Less efficient tokenization means LLMs are effectively less capable in non-English — more context consumed per concept.

---

### 37. Superposition & Mechanistic Interpretability

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Superposition: networks represent more features than dimensions by encoding concepts in overlapping, near-orthogonal patterns. Individual neurons are polysemantic (multiple unrelated features).
- **Context:** Works because most features are sparse (rarely active), so interference is tolerable.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Sparse autoencoders decompose internal activations into interpretable features by training an overcomplete autoencoder with a sparsity penalty on the residual stream.
- **Context:** Anthropic's research: SAE features can steer model behavior — amplify or suppress concepts at inference time.

**Point 3**
- **Content:** Mechanistic interpretability reverse-engineers networks into circuits — small subgraphs implementing specific behaviors. Goal: move from "what" (behavioral testing) to "how" (internal mechanism).
- **Context:** Key finding: induction heads implement in-context learning. Matters for safety — detect deception or bias before deployment.

---

## Procedural/Technical — Databases & Infrastructure

### 38. How B-Tree Indexes Work

**Point 1**
- **Content:** B-tree: self-balancing tree with sorted keys per node. Lookups are O(log n) — 1 billion rows needs only 3-4 disk reads.
- **Context:** Without an index, the database scans every row (O(n)). All leaf nodes at the same depth ensures consistent performance.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** B+ trees (used by SQLite, Postgres, MySQL) store data pointers only in leaf nodes, linked in a chain — making range queries efficient via leaf-to-leaf traversal.
- **Context:** Indexes speed reads but slow writes (every INSERT/UPDATE must also update the index).

---

### 39. How Docker Containers Actually Isolate

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Containers share the host kernel. Isolation comes from Linux namespaces (PID, network, mount, user) — each container gets its own view of processes, network, and filesystem.
- **Context:** A container's PID 1 is only PID 1 inside its namespace; on the host it has a different PID.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Resource limits via cgroups (CPU, memory, I/O). Layered filesystem (overlay2) stacks read-only image layers with a thin writable layer — images are immutable, containers start instantly.
- **Context:** Layers are shared between containers using the same base image. The writable layer is discarded on stop unless volumes are used.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Neuroscience

### 40. The Gut-Brain Axis

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The gut-brain axis: bidirectional communication between 100M+ gut neurons and the CNS via the vagus nerve. ~95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut.
- **Context:** The enteric nervous system operates independently of the CNS. GI symptoms frequently accompany anxiety and depression.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Microbiome composition directly influences mood. Germ-free mice show exaggerated stress responses that normalize with specific Lactobacillus strains.
- **Context:** Diet changes can shift microbiome composition within days. "Gut feelings" are more than metaphor — interoceptive signals genuinely inform emotional processing.

---

## Creative/Design — Drawing & Visual Art

### 41. Contour Drawing & Negative Space

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Blind contour drawing — drawing without looking at the paper — bypasses the brain's symbolic system and engages direct perceptual processing.
- **Context:** Betty Edwards' framework. The symbolic brain draws what it "knows"; blind contour trains you to draw what you actually see.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Drawing negative space (shapes around/between objects) produces accurate proportions because the brain has no symbolic template for empty space.
- **Context:** Draw the air between a chair's legs and the chair emerges accurately. The brain can't interfere with shapes it has no schema for.

---

### 42. How Chiaroscuro Creates Depth

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Chiaroscuro uses strong light-dark contrasts to model 3D form on a flat surface by simulating how light wraps around volume.
- **Context:** Caravaggio's tenebrism: figures from near-total darkness. Value range (lightest to darkest) creates volume illusion more effectively than color or line.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Math (continued)

### 43. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems

**Point 1**
- **Content:** First theorem: any consistent formal system powerful enough for arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven within the system.
- **Context:** Gödel constructs a self-referential statement: "this statement is not provable." If provable → inconsistent; if unprovable → true. Either way, incomplete.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Second theorem: no such system can prove its own consistency. You always need a stronger system — which then can't prove its own consistency either.
- **Context:** Killed Hilbert's program. Connects to the halting problem — computability and provability have the same limits.

---

### 44. Eigenvectors Geometrically

**Point 1**
- **Content:** An eigenvector of matrix A only gets scaled, not rotated: Av = λv. Eigenvectors reveal the "natural axes" of a linear transformation.
- **Context:** Most vectors change direction under a matrix. A 2D stretch doubling horizontally and halving vertically has eigenvectors along H and V axes (λ = 2, 0.5).

**Point 2**
- **Content:** PCA finds eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The largest eigenvalue's eigenvector points in the direction of greatest variance — the most informative axis.
- **Context:** 1000 features → 50 principal components capturing 95% of variance. The eigenvalue tells you how much each component explains.

---

### 45. How the Fourier Transform Decomposes Signals

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The Fourier transform decomposes any signal into sine waves at different frequencies, converting time-domain to frequency-domain.
- **Context:** Fourier, 1807: any periodic function = infinite sum of sines and cosines. The transform generalizes to non-periodic signals.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** FFT computes the discrete Fourier transform in O(n log n) instead of O(n²). It's behind MP3, JPEG, OFDM, MRI, and speech recognition.
- **Context:** Cooley-Tukey, 1965. Without FFT, digital audio and image processing would be computationally infeasible.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Philosophy & Literature (continued)

### 46. Borges & The Library of Babel

**Point 1**
- **Content:** The Library of Babel contains every possible 410-page book using 25 symbols — every true statement, every false one, and every gibberish string. Total information = no information.
- **Context:** If every possible book exists, finding a specific true one is impossible. A thought experiment about the difference between information and knowledge.

---

### 47. Negative Capability (Keats)

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Negative Capability (Keats, 1817): "being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." The capacity to remain in ambiguity without forcing closure.
- **Context:** Keats identified Shakespeare as the example — characters embody contradictory truths without resolution. Resonates with mindfulness and creative process.

---

### 48. Heidegger's Ready-to-Hand vs Present-at-Hand

**Point 1**
- **Content:** "Ready-to-hand": equipment in use withdraws from attention (a hammer used is an extension of the body). "Present-at-hand": equipment noticed as a detached object (the hammer examined when broken).
- **Context:** Primary engagement with the world is absorbed activity, not detached observation. We encounter things first as tools-in-use, not objects-with-properties.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — Psychology (continued)

### 49. Transference in Psychoanalysis

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Transference: the patient unconsciously redirects relational patterns from early caregivers onto the therapist. The therapist becomes a screen for projected dynamics.
- **Context:** Freud realized it wasn't an obstacle but the treatment — live reenactment provides material for insight.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Countertransference: the therapist's unconscious emotional reaction to the patient. Modern practice treats it as diagnostic data — the therapist's feelings mirror what others in the patient's life feel.
- **Context:** If a therapist consistently feels bored or controlled with a patient, that likely reflects the dynamic the patient creates everywhere.

---

## Conceptual Knowledge — History & Economics

### 50. The Bretton Woods System & Its Collapse

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Bretton Woods (1944): USD pegged to gold at $35/oz, all major currencies pegged to USD. Created the IMF and World Bank.
- **Context:** 44 allied nations, near end of WWII. Goal: prevent competitive devaluations that worsened the Great Depression.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Collapsed 1971 (Nixon Shock): US ended gold convertibility because reserves couldn't cover dollars held abroad. Triggered today's floating exchange rate system.
- **Context:** Triffin's dilemma: US had to run deficits to supply dollars, but deficits eroded confidence in the gold backing.

---

## Culinary

### 51. How to Make a Phenomenal Beef Ragù

**Point 1**
- **Content:** Collagen-rich cuts (chuck, short rib) are essential — collagen converts to gelatin during slow braising (3+ hours), creating body that lean cuts can't produce.
- **Context:** Large chunks, hard-sear in batches for fond, deglaze with red wine. Soffritto base. Braise in wine + crushed tomato until fork-tender.

**Point 2**
- **Content:** Toss pasta *in* the ragù (never sauce on top), using starchy pasta water to emulsify into a glossy glaze that clings to every strand.
- **Context:** Wide textured pasta (pappardelle, tagliatelle). Reserve pasta water before draining. Finish with Parmigiano and olive oil off heat.
