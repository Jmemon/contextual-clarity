# Phase 4: Discussion Schedule

20 rounds of 20 sessions each (400 total). Each round is its own file — check off sessions as you go, jot notes at the bottom.

**Deep-dive:** 5 motivation + 5 ATP per round (100 each by end).
**Diverse:** 10 sets per round, rotating through 5 groups. Each set gets 4 sessions total.
**Session order:** Interleaved — (1 motivation, 1 ATP, 2 diverse) × 5 per round for variety.
