# Round 1
*Motivation #1-5, ATP #1-5 · Group A session 1/4*

- [ ] Motivation #1
Felt long and I wasn't sure how I was doing.

- [ ] ATP #1
Very easy.

- [ ] Atomic Habits: The Habit Loop (1/4)
Very verbose. I think the llm should be generating prodding/prompting text. Short, to the point, gets the user thinking in the direction of the next recall point. We could definitely have a lot more going on behind-the-scenes to get to this (agents analyzing convo and prev convos and system prompt) but teh user shouldn't have to deal with buzzfeed-style llm responses.

- [ ] Caffeine & Adenosine (1/4)
Instead of an llm back-and-forth the recall-session agent should have moves beyond just text responses. Another move should be recall-point recalled. so taht this doesn't show up in text, but maybe is rendered in the ui as a check mark or some positive feedback. 

The questions the llm asks are a bit ambiguous at times. Like my answers are valid answers but the llm was trying to get at something else. Maybe the recall-session-agent (RSA) second-guesses formulation by proposing valid answers to help refine the RSA generated text.

**Notes (have claude look at the sessions (should be stored in DB) and to create tickets for repo changes from these notes and what happened in the convos):**
I think these sessions should be spoken (or maybe written (like with finger or something)). Typing allows for a certain mindlessness.
Like what if you didn't see your previous messages. You spoke in response to whatever prompt the system has on the screen, and you just talk to it. Like you don't have written down what you sar previously in a conversation.

The "I've got it" thing doesn't make sense. The system should be assessing which points we've hit as soon we hit them, so the AI can end the convo when they've hit the points (optionally, if the user wants to keep going they can, that's when the "I've got it" button would come in)

Visual progress. I don't like wondering how much longer I have. Tell me how many points I've gotten and how many I have left. Maybe other stats too like number of rabbitholes.

maybe we should have a mobile version as well so I can try this out as I'm going about my life (which is what it will probably really be like.)

We should have one discussion prompt/agent that generates good questions in the convos. Instead of specifying for every set. Maybe it can have some per-set guidelines added in (and this should be generated automatically via noting interactions with the user eg somehting hte ai said was misunderstood by the user)

**Prompt changes after this round:**
