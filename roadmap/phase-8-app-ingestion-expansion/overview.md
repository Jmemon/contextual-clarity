# Phase 8: App Ingestion Expansion

We will add an ingestion workspace to the app. The user will not manage sets or anything like that from the app or see prior sessions or anything. The app will remain minimal, but add in an option to ingest resources+transcript to iteratively create new recall set(s).

## Why add it in?

It feels right. Why? I think it's because with the personal-assistant-ux style we want the only exposed parts of the UI to be constructive functionality. These are acceptable as they feel like the user is progressing in some way. Managerial tasks are headaches/annoying—these are things best hidden on the app, accessible on the desktop.

I don't quite think I've nailed the description of what the personal-assistant-ux goes for. Maybe high-signal tasks, tasks that *feel* progressive.

Okay this is helpful: tasks that do MORE for the user than for the AI. Tasks that are the user communicating their internal concepts to the AI in the form of managing app logistics should be hidden, because the user is having to bear the mental load of translating what they want into the settings available in the app. But having the user talk through raw resources—this is the core work they SHOULD be doing if they are using this app, that actually SERVES them.
