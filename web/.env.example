# Frontend environment configuration (optional)
#
# In development, the Vite proxy reads PORT from the root .env file,
# so you typically don't need to set anything here.
#
# Only set VITE_API_BASE_URL if you need to connect to a different backend
# (e.g., a remote server or a different local port).

# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3011
